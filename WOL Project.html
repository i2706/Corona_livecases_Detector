          <div class="content">
          <p>The Coronavirus belongs to the family of viruses which ranges from common cold virus to SARS virus. It can cause respiratory tract infections in humans which are life-threatening. The virus is named after its shape which takes the form of a crown with protrusions around it and hence is known as ‘Coronavirus’. Coronavirus disease is known to be originated from Wuhan,China in December 2019, thus it is named as ‘COVID-19’This virus spreads primarily when a healthy person comes in contact with droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. .There is no specific vaccine known yet, but according to the WHO, "many of the symptoms can be treated & therefore treatment is based on the patient’s clinical condition".</p>

            <div class="precautions">
              <ul>
                <li><h3>Wash your hands frequently</h3>
                  <p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water because kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                  <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing  because when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                  <h3>Practice respiratory hygiene</h3>
